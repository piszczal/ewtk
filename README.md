# EWTK - Mobile APP (Android)

Mobile devices in health care – a system of mobile and web application for supporting clinical trials – teamwork.

Clinical trials aim at validation of effectiveness of a medical intervention, e.g., a drug. The goal of this project was to improve the way clinical trials are conducted, from manual to automated, with use of internet and mobile applications and a server. Internet application supports trial designers in creating and managing clinical trials. Mobile apps help participants to collect data and transfer data to the Clinical Trial Center. Our solution also allows to reuse certain parts of clinical trials in other similar studies, further accelerating and reducing the cost of the process of designing and conducting clinical trials. Our system was implemented with help of the following technologies and frameworks: PHP, Laravel 5.2, MySQL, Pusher, HTML5, AngularJS, MVC, Java, Android SDK and Spring for Android.
